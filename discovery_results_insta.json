Something about the seasons changing into fall makes it feel like a natural reset….\n\nLooking back, this last year has been a big one. It started with me flying to SF to interview Mark Zuckerberg. From there, focusing on expanding and growing my Talk Tech with Tiff podcast (on quality interview trying to release max one a month…) sitting down with thought  leaders like Jensen Huang, Satya Nadella, Eliot Horowitz, and many others.\n\nOutside of the podcast, life also changed in a big way: end of May we welcomed our baby boy, who by the way is coming with me on his first trip to San Francisco today (wish me luck travelling haha). Starting him early in tech, I guess.\n\nI also focused more on public speaking, expanded our YouTube deep dives, and took on consulting with some of the biggest tech companies in the world. \n\nAnd before I found out I was pregnant, I had actually started graduate studies that I ended up putting on hold. That time away made me realize how much I wanted to keep pushing myself, so I applied to Stanford and I’ll now be starting my graduate studies in AI & ML next week! I will be studying remotely of course but can’t wait for this next chapter and to share my learnings with you alll. I deciddd to do this because I talk a lot about these topics and consult on them… why not continue to gain as much education on them as I can? \n\nI don’t know exactly how we’ll balance it all, but that’s kind of how things have always gone: we just figure it out.\n\nHere’s to what’s next 🥂",

But they don’t send maps at all. They send time signals… precise atomic-clock timestamps. So how does your phone turn those timestamps into your exact spot on Earth?\n\nHere is how it works.. your phone measures how long each satellite’s signal took to arrive.\n\nSince signals travel at the speed of light, even a delay of a few billionths of a second means you’re thousands of meters closer to one satellite than another.\n\nBy turning those times into distances, your phone draws invisible spheres around each satellite.\n\nWhere those spheres overlap… That’s your location. With at least four satellites, it locks in your latitude, longitude, and altitude with meter-level accuracy.\n\nAnd it only works because those satellites carry atomic clocks so precise they drift about a billionth of a second per day. Think about it: if the timing was off by just one microsecond, your GPS would be hundreds of meters wrong.\n\n#tech #stem #technology #futuretech #techexplained",

Every time we push electricity through metal wires it creates friction. If we try to make chips move data any faster the resistance creates enough heat to melt the silicon. This is why AI power consumption is spiraling.\n\nLightmatter found the solution….\nTheir platform called Passage replaces copper wires with Silicon Photonics. Instead of electricity it uses beams of light moving through microscopic glass tunnels.\n\n• Zero Mass: Photons move with no resistance and virtually no heat.\n\n• 100x Faster: Their M1000 chip moves 114 Terabits of data per second. This dwarfs traditional electronic interconnects.\n\n• Green AI: We can finally scale AI models to be 1000x smarter without overloading the global power grid.\n\nThe future of computing is not just about smaller transistors.

Time in space runs 38 microseconds faster than time on Earth, every single day.\n\nThat sounds small but light travels 300 meters in a single microsecond.

Trained at 1080p with fully licensed data so it’s clean. But clean is not enough. We need control. Control of our art whether it’s being trained on or it’s what you’re creating. They said it was impossible to make a model without piracy and scrapping data. Marey proved that to be wrong. The future is what you make it. \n\nMoonvalley went above and beyond to listen to the industry needs. Controls to animate the camera based on input videos or images. Control to direct an objects around a scene. Control to have an actor give a specific performance. Control to add over 120 keyframes. And so many more coming.\n\nTry it out at moonvalley.com\n\nCollaboration with the talented mister @mowgly_lee",

From the 2+months of working with my amazing curator Simone, the Ted team and Speaker Coach Briar Goldberg, to visiting Vancouver for the first time and overcoming my fear of being doxxed + wondering how people would react to this AI work. (Like I said to Simone it’s either a Ted talk or a bunjee jump)\n\nI am fortunate to have @monica_lewinsky as my TED ambassador guiding me and giving me great tips for the talk. She and Simone gave me great emotional support, i am so grateful. What beautiful souls. @scr10 \n\nDuring the week I listened to astrophysicists, scientists, farmers, artists, thought leaders— beautiful brilliant minds sharing their genius. I’m moved, inspired, hugely honoured and 3000% mind-expanded. \nTHANK YOU 🫶",

To keep your information private and secure, your health chats, files, and memories are kept in a separate dedicated space. Health conversation info never flows into your regular chats and is not used for model training. You can view or delete Health memories in Health or Settings > Personalization.\n\nWe’re rolling out to a small group of users first so we can learn and improve the experience, and plan to expand to everyone on web & iOS soon.\n\nJoin the waitlist for early access: https://chatgpt.com/health/waitlist",
