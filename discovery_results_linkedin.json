Currently working on an interesting search/summarization engine using NLP, transformers, GPT, and tailor-made generative models.\n\nAidetic is a data-driven company and I am helping my team to deploy enterprise-grade AI solutions with the philosophy of seamless integration and consistent improvement instead of disruption. i.e. I encourage the team members to understand the problem and build on top of existing solutions as opposed to scraping previous work and re-inventing the wheel.",

        "content": "Grid search or TPE? Which approach is better for hyperparameter optimization?  \n \nThis question came up while we were tuning a model where a single training run took multiple hours and the hyperparameter space wasn’t small.  \n \nWe had to tune learning rates, regularization terms, batch sizes, model-specific knobs, etc, many of them were continuous.  \n \nAt that point, the choice of how to search started to matter as much as what we were tuning. \n\nGrid Search works by exhaustively evaluating a predefined set of hyperparameter combinations. Each configuration is tried independently, without using information from previous runs. This makes Grid Search simple and deterministic, but increasingly expensive as the search space grows. \n\nTPE, on the other hand, is an adaptive approach. It starts with a small number of exploratory trials, then builds a probabilistic model that links hyperparameter choices to observed performance. Future trials are selected based on what the model has learned so far, balancing exploration of new regions with refinement of promising ones. \n\nIn practice, this difference matters most when: \n\n- Hyperparameter spaces are large or continuous \n- Training runs are computationally expensive \n- Iteration speed is important \n\nGrid Search guarantees full coverage of a fixed grid, which can be useful for small or well-bounded problems. TPE tends to reach strong configurations faster by allocating more effort to regions that show early promise. \n\nHow are you approaching optimizing hyperparameter in your workflows?",

        "content": "When we say LLMs call tools, we usually picture functions or APIs. That framing is misleading. \n\nA tool isn’t a function. \n \nIt’s structured output from a probabilistic model that your code interprets and executes deterministically. \n\nOnce you see tools this way, several things change: \n\n1. Separation of concerns\nThe model decides what should happen. \nYour system decides how it happens. \nThis makes AI systems safer, easier to debug, and far more predictable. \n\n2. Flexible workflows \nA single tool call doesn’t need to map to one function. \nIt can trigger a pipeline, update multiple systems, or modify internal state all driven by one structured response. \n\n3. Testability and observability \nBecause outputs follow a schema, you can validate them before execution, simulate flows, and log decisions. \nThis dramatically speeds up iteration and reduces production risk. \n\n4. Composable system design \nWhen every interaction follows a schema, you can extend or orchestrate capabilities without retraining the model or rewriting agent logic. \n\nThe real value is in treating tools as interfaces between probabilistic reasoning and deterministic systems. \n\nThat mindset shift is what makes AI systems easier to scale, reason about, and maintain in production.",

A scrappy startup gets a meeting with a global entertainment conglomerate or a Fortune 500 bank. The founders start popping champagne. They think they’ve made it.\nI call it \"Chasing the Elephant.\" But here’s the thing about elephants: if they roll over in their sleep, you get crushed.\nOne of my first jobs was at a massive entertainment conglomerate. My boss back then used to say something that sounded like a joke, but was actually a warning:\n\"We put startups out of business just by giving them business.\"\nIt sounds paradoxical, but it’s a cold, hard reality. Here is why chasing the \"marquee client\" too early is like trying to win a marathon by sprinting into a brick wall:\nThe \"Soon\" Cycle: In Big Corp speak, \"We'll get back to you next week\" actually means \"We are entering a 9-month procurement review involving 14 departments you didn't know existed.\"\nDeath by Pilot: They love your \"innovation.\" They want a pilot. Then a security audit. By the time you get to \"Go-Live,\" your runway has been consumed by coffee meetings and 60-page RFP responses.\nThe Customization Sinkhole: They don't want your product; they want a version of your product that only works for them, built by your entire engineering team, for the price of a standard subscription.\nNet-Never Payment Terms: You’re a startup living month-to-month. They have \"Net-120\" payment terms. You’ll be a historical footnote by the time their accounting department clicks \"send\" on that wire transfer.\nThe Lesson? Don't ignore the \"Deer\" while you're hunting the \"Elephant.\"\nMiddle-market customers might not have the \"cool\" logo for your pitch deck, but they make decisions in weeks, pay on time, and actually help you build a sustainable business.\nIf you spend all your energy chasing one massive beast, don't be surprised when you run out of oxygen before the hunt even begins.\nHave you ever been \"crushed\" by a dream client?

        "content": "One of the hurdles I recently went through while publishing my research is how convoluted and difficult the system is for independent researchers who don’t have industry contacts, professors, or access to RnD departments in companies.\n\nIt is almost impossible to get verified at multiple steps of the process. This starts as early as signing up on research-related websites, many of which require institutional email IDs. My college didn’t help with my research, and when I did most of this work, I wasn’t affiliated with an institution the way I am now. Some platforms have human moderation for personal emails, while others outright deny access if you don’t have an institutional one.\n\nThat’s just the signup stage. Later, even for preprint servers like arXiv, you need endorsements. I understand why this exists, especially with the amount of AI spam today, and it is a reasonable way to prevent abuse. But there should be a way to access endorsers without resorting to cold emailing strangers. People in institutions can simply ask a professor or senior. It’s literally a single click for them, and sometimes it doesn’t even require an endorsement if they have an institutional email.\n\nI do understand why the system is designed this way. Most research is done within universities or corporate RnD, and the system works well for that. There is also a valid assumption that not many unrecognised or unemployed individuals will publish strong papers, and statistically that makes sense.\n\nHowever, with the advent of AI, things have changed. While it has made filtering reliable research harder, it has also provided education without universities, coding ability to people who had ideas but couldn’t translate them into code or good English, and access to computing resources that were previously unavailable. Because of this, it feels necessary to think about improving the system for people who are capable but don’t have institutional support.\n\nJust a thought.\n\n#Research  #Academia #ArXiv #MachineLearning #OpenScience #Publishing #ResearchCommunity",

The more I explored it, the clearer it became: this wasn’t just a technical challenge, it was a human one.\n\nThat’s where the idea of 𝗔𝗜 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 was born.\n\nInstead of AI being a side tool, what if it worked with employees handling repetitive tasks, supporting decisions, and freeing people to focus on what actually moves the organizations forward?\n\nThat vision became Ozoo.\n\nThe last year at HabileLabs has been a beautiful ride full of learning, experimentation, and the joy of working with motivated peers who believe in building something meaningful. I didn’t just work on a product; I fell in love with a problem worth solving for the world.\n\nAs we step into the next year, the focus is clear: turning this vision into reality, together.\n\nCheers to 1 year at HabileLabs and many more to come!\n\n#workanniversary #HabileLabs #Ozoo #AITeammate #AITeammember #Workculture Shankar Morwal Shreya Malot Ankit Dhir",

        "content": "Importance of AI-Powered Natural Language Search in Real-World Data (RWD)\nReal-World Data (RWD) is massive, complex, and often unstructured, coming from research articles, clinical notes, patient records, insurance claims, and even wearable devices. Traditional search methods struggle to extract meaningful insights quickly. AI-powered Natural Language Search (NLS) allows researchers and life science professionals to query data in plain human language and get accurate, context-aware results.\n\nSimplifying Access to Complex Data - \nMost RWD exists in unstructured formats (clinical narratives, physician notes). AI-powered NLS can understand context, synonyms, and medical terminology, making it easier to search without requiring technical query skills.\n\nExample: Instead of typing database codes, a researcher can simply ask: “Show me adverse events of Drug X in diabetic patients over 50.”\n\nAccelerating Research & Decision-Making: - \nCuts down the time spent on manual data mining. Provides faster insights into patient outcomes, drug effectiveness, and treatment patterns .Supports data-driven decisions in clinical development, regulatory submissions, and market access.\n\nImproving Regulatory & Compliance Workflows: - \nRegulators often require evidence from vast real-world datasets.\nNatural language search helps regulatory teams find safety signals, adverse events, or compliance gaps quickly. Ensures more transparent and traceable evidence generation for FDA, EMA, and other authorities.\n\nEnabling Personalized Medicine:-\nAI-powered search can segment RWD by patient demographics, comorbidities, or treatment response. This enables researchers to identify subgroups that benefit most from a therapy.\nMakes real-world evidence more actionable for precision medicine strategies.\n\nEnhancing Collaboration Across Teams\nNon-technical stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, business leaders) can query data directly without needing data scientists. Reduces dependency on IT or analytics teams. Improves cross-functional collaboration in pharma, biotech, and healthcare organizations.\n\n\nAI-powered Natural Language Search transforms how Real-World Data is used in the life sciences industry. By making data searchable, understandable, and actionable, it unlocks faster insights, supports regulatory compliance, accelerates innovation, and empowers personalized patient care. In an industry where speed and accuracy are critical, natural language search is not just a convenience it is a strategic necessity.\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #NaturalLanguageSearch #LifeSciences #RealWorldData #RealWorldEvidence #HealthcareInnovation #PharmaTech",

Now it’s about governance—or get left behind.\n\nFor years, the prevailing wisdom has been: “Run fast with AI pilots, experiment widely, you’ll figure out scaling later.”\n\nBut here’s what too few execs are seeing:  \nThose ungoverned experiments are becoming enterprise landmines—fragmented models, duplicated efforts, mounting risk. And when the regulation hits (and it will), you can’t unwind chaos at scale.\n\nI’ve watched this play out up close.\n\nIn one global manufacturer, dozens of AI pilots bloomed independently—computer vision here, demand forecasting there—all siloed across legacy systems. Impressive on paper. Useless in practice. Value stalled at just 20% of forecasted impact. Why? No shared governance.\n\nWe helped unwind the mess—building a cross-functional AI governance model that tied together data lineage, risk thresholds, ownership, and measurable ROI gates. Only then could they scale safely—and extract real value.\n\nThis isn’t unique. Retail, healthcare, financial services—AI is becoming agentic, autonomous. But without operational guardrails? It’s a ticking credibility bomb.\n\nSo here’s the shift leaders need to make:\n\n✅ Stand up an AI Center of Excellence with cross-functional teeth  \n✅ Define objective scaling criteria—aligned to real-world risk and business value  \n✅ Govern now, before the sprawl governs you  \n\nAI value isn’t just about GenAI breakthroughs—it’s about control, clarity, and trust at scale.\n\nWhat’s the biggest governance blind spot in your org right now—and who actually owns it?\n\n#EnterpriseAI #AIGovernance #TechLeadership",

It wowed with early results—30% faster predictions and high stakeholder visibility.\n\nBut under the surface?\n\nCross-functional confusion on ownership. Data silos degrading model accuracy. No governance to check hallucinations. And when regulators started asking tough compliance questions, leadership finally asked, \"Who owns this?\"\n\nNobody did.\n\n18 months in, we had to shut it down. Not because the tech didn’t work—but because it was outpacing the business.\n\nMy mistake? I underestimated the gulf between technical capability and operational accountability. I let excitement override alignment.\n\nThat was the lesson.\n\nMy guidance now?  \n✅ Spend disproportionate time on data quality and governance—early.  \n✅ Map pilots to business-owned KPIs, not just model metrics.  \n✅ And don’t be afraid to kill with intention. Not everything needs to scale.\n\nAI pilots shouldn't be playgrounds for innovation—they’re testbeds for value.\n\nAsk yourself: Is your AI pilot a tech experiment…or a business product?\n\n#EnterpriseAI #DigitalTransformation #LeadershipLessons",

Governance gaps hiding in plain sight — like invisible sand in the gears of your AI machine.\n\nI’ve seen promising pilots stall for months (or die entirely) not because the tech was wrong — but because we couldn’t resolve basic operational questions:  \n- Which system “owns” the truth?  \n- Who approves agent decisions in a high-stakes process?  \n- How fast can we trace and correct a rogue output?\n\nIn one enterprise rollout, real-time AI insights sat idle for months because legacy systems couldn’t sync cleanly.

Or the team.\n\nBut after 20+ years advising execs on large-scale transformation, I’ve seen this pattern unfold again and again—and the real issue isn’t technical.\n\nIt’s structural.\n\nThe gap between what AI can do vs. what organizations can operationalize is wider than ever.\n\nRecent research says 40% of enterprise AI investments will fail to meet objectives by 2026. Not because the models don’t work—but because:\n\n1️⃣ The business case is an afterthought. If your AI use case isn’t tied directly to P&L-impacting KPIs, it’s a science fair project.  \n\n2️⃣ Governance comes too late.

Prompts? Too generic. Too risky. Too junior.\n\nBut here’s the reality: In 2026, your audience doesn’t care who typed the first draft. They care whether it’s clear, credible, and drives action. The cost of fuzzy, slow communication now compounds across teams, markets, and trust with the board.\n\nIn one recent transformation effort, a senior exec and I rewrote a board memo—three times—because it buried the actual ROI under tech lingo. That delay? It pushed our funding pitch by two weeks. That’s a measurable hit in a volatile market.\n\nI’ve since adopted a new rule: If I can’t explain the “why” and “how” of an AI initiative—clearly, in 400 words or less—it’s not ready. ChatGPT helps me get there, faster. The right prompt sharpens my thinking, doesn’t replace it.\n\nHere’s one I use often:\n\n\"Act as a senior tech advisor with 20+ years in AI.

        "content": "Monday Musings: Edge or Cloud?\n\nWhile this comes up a lot, the question isn't \"edge or cloud\" anymore. It's \"which data goes where and when?\"\n\nAnd I've learned that getting the location wrong can render an otherwise brilliant solution ineffective.\n\nHere's the thing: a 2-second delay doesn't matter when you're analyzing last quarter's sales trends. But when you're monitoring a warehouse forklift in real-time? Two seconds means the vehicle has already moved three feet. By the time a cloud-based alert arrives, the potential collision has either happened or been avoided.\n\nLocation matters.\n\nWe utilize cloud computing when we require substantial processing power and can tolerate some latency. Pattern analysis across multiple facilities, training AI models on massive datasets, generating insights from weeks of accumulated data - that all happens in the cloud.\n\nEdge computing wins when speed and reliability are non-negotiable. Real-time process monitoring, immediate safety alerts, and operations in locations with unreliable internet.\n\nA cloud-only solution would go blind every time connectivity failed. Quality control can't afford that.\n\nEdge devices detect defects in real time, even when offline. When the connection is restored, they sync with the cloud for deeper analysis and model improvement.\n\nBandwidth economics matter too. One retail client has hundreds of cameras. Streaming all that video to the cloud 24/7? Their monthly bill would be astronomical.\n\nSolution: process locally, only send interesting events to the cloud. Customer enters the store? Send it up. Empty aisles at 3 AM? Keep it local.\n\nPrivacy considerations also drive edge decisions. Some companies won't allow sensitive operational data to leave their premises. Edge processing keeps it contained while still delivering insights.\n\nBut edge isn't perfect. Those local devices need maintenance. Software updates get complex across 50 locations. And you're limited by whatever processing power you've installed on-site.\n\nThe reality? Most sophisticated AI systems today are hybrid.\n\nProcess locally for speed, reliability, or privacy. Use the cloud for heavy computation, long-term storage, and cross-location insights.\n\nI've stopped thinking in terms of binary choices, and we've started designing workflows that direct data to where it's processed most effectively.\n\nThe technology choice should be invisible to users. They just want their AI agent to work—whether it's thinking at the edge, in the cloud, or both.\n\nAnd honestly, that's the whole point. Match the technology to the business need, not the other way around.\n\n#EdgeComputing #CloudComputing #AI #AgenticAI #ProcessIntelligence #TechnologyStrategy",

        "content": "Monday Musings: The Shifting Academic Order and What It Means for Innovation\n\nThe headlines this week should make anyone building technology companies pay attention: Harvard has dropped to No. 3 in the Leiden Rankings, while seven of the top 10 research universities are now Chinese. Twenty years ago, seven American schools would have held those top spots. (https://lnkd.in/gmUU-Ymy)  \n\nThe innovation pipeline is changing. \nInternational student arrivals to the U.S. dropped 19% in August 2025. When the world's brightest minds choose to study elsewhere, the effects compound. Today's graduate students are tomorrow's research leaders and startup founders.  \n\nChina has been pouring billions into universities while American schools grapple with federal grant reductions. Harvard still produces more research than before, but volume alone doesn't maintain leadership when competitors are moving faster. \n\nWhy this matters beyond academia \nScientific leadership drives technological leadership. The countries that produce breakthrough research in AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology will shape the industries built on these technologies. When China dominates chemistry, the physical sciences, and, increasingly, other fields, it shapes the emergence of future innovation clusters. \nAmerican technological dominance has rested on academic excellence, open immigration for talent, and massive research infrastructure. That foundation is cracking. \n\nThe paradox nobody's addressing \nIndian universities remain absent from the top 500 in some rankings, yet Indian Americans lead across U.S. technological, scientific, and academic disciplines. Indian talent thrives in American institutions but hasn't yet translated to elevating Indian universities to similar heights. (And it is the same for the Indian diaspora in other developed nations.) \nThis tells you something: institutional infrastructure, funding stability, and research culture matter as much as raw talent. China understands this: its rise came from sustained, strategic investment over decades. \n\nWhat this means for Western leadership \nIf you're a technology leader in North America or Europe, this affects your talent pipeline, research partnerships, and competitive position. The ecosystem that produced generations of innovation is under pressure from multiple directions. \n\nAmerican universities aren't necessarily getting worse—the global competition is advancing more rapidly. Scientific leadership has historically preceded technological and economic leadership. \nWe need honest conversations about research funding, immigration policy, and the infrastructure supporting academic excellence. Short-term political considerations are creating long-term strategic vulnerabilities. This isn't an inevitable decline, but it requires recognizing the problem and responding with strategic intent.",

        "content": "Monday Musings: The Job Categories That Don't Exist Yet\n\nAt a recent family gathering, a friend's daughter asked if AI would take her job.\n\nShe's 14. She doesn't even have a job yet and is four years from college.\n\nI told her something that surprised her: \"The job you'll end up doing doesn't exist today.\"\n\nTen years ago, \"AI Prompt Engineer\" or “Context Engineer” wasn't a thing. Neither was \"Cloud Solutions Architect.\" Go back twenty years, and \"Data Scientist\" was barely a concept.\n\nEvery technological shift creates jobs we can't imagine beforehand.\n\nAt Skan, I'm witnessing this in real-time. Ten years ago, in our previous company, we hired traditional business analysts to map workflows. We now have \"Process Intelligence Specialists\" who can interpret AI-generated observations and translate them into effective automation strategies.\n\nThat job didn't exist before computer vision could monitor work in progress.\n\nRecently, I saw a posting for an \"Agent Behavior Designer\" – someone who shapes how AI agents make decisions in ambiguous situations. It's part psychology, part programming, part business strategy. There's no degree program for this yet.\n\nDon't get me wrong – AI is absolutely disrupting existing roles. When we deploy agents that handle invoice processing automatically, we need fewer people for manual data entry.\n\nHowever, for every routine task that AI eliminates, it creates new work that requires human judgment.\n\nThe new jobs cluster around AI oversight, customization, and strategy.\n\nCompanies are hiring \"AI Trainers\" who teach agents industry-specific nuances. \"Automation Ethicists\" who ensure fair decisions. \"Human-AI Collaboration Specialists\" who design effective human-agent workflows.\n\nMy previous company experienced this during the mobile revolution. We eliminated desktop support roles but created new positions, including mobile app developers, UX designers, and digital product managers. Different skills, often better paying.\n\nThe pattern is consistent: technology eliminates routine work and creates complex work.\n\nThe challenge isn't that new jobs won't exist – it's that they require different skills. An invoice processing clerk can't automatically become an AI trainer without retraining.\n\nThat's where we all have responsibility. Companies need to invest in reskilling. Educational institutions need to adapt faster.\n\nBut here's the optimistic part: the new jobs are often more interesting.\n\nInstead of manually keying data, people design intelligent systems. Instead of following scripts, they create adaptive workflows. Instead of repetitive tasks, they solve novel problems.\n\nMy friend's daughter will likely work with AI in ways we can't imagine. Maybe as an \"AI Archaeologist\" investigating automated decisions. Or a \"Synthetic Data Artist\" creating training scenarios.\n\nThe future isn't humans versus machines. It's humans and machines creating value together.\n\n#FutureOfWork #AI #JobCreation #Reskilling #AgenticAI #WorkforceTransformation",

𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀: treat each MCP tool as a versioned, testable API surface with strict schemas, auth scopes, and SLAs, not as a “convenience wrapper” hidden inside prompt code.\n\n 2. 𝗦𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: let your workflow engine (orchestrator) own state, routing, retries, and compensations, and let MCP tools + models handle reasoning and side effects behind that control plane.\n\n 3. 𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹 𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝘆: enforce identity, permissions, rate limits, tenant isolation, and audit logging at the MCP layer so every model and agent inherits the same guardrails by design.\n\n 4. 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: write conformance tests at the MCP level so you can plug different LLMs or agent runtimes into the same tool graph without re-wiring business logic.\n\n 5. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝗠𝗖𝗣-𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹-𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲: when you design a new agentic workflow, start by asking “what MCP tools and flows do we expose?” rather than “what should this model prompt say?” so your investment lives in protocols, not in one provider’s SDK.\n\nIf MCP is the “USB-C for AI agents,” the 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 won’t be who has the flashiest agent demo—it’ll be who designs the cleanest, most 𝗴𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗠𝗖𝗣-𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 across their stack.",

What requires human approval?\n • Scopes: Read-only vs write vs \"can trigger money or production changes.\"\n • Ownership: Who is accountable for this agent’s behavior?\n\nOnly after this should you ask, \"What tools do we give it?\"\n\n𝟮. 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆\nYour agent doesn’t need full \"hands on keyboard\" access on day one.\n • Phase 1: Suggest only (human executes)\n • Phase 2: Execute with approval (human in the loop)\n • Phase 3: Execute with review (spot checks + monitoring)\n\nTie each step to measurable risk: incident rate, override rate, policy violations.\n\n𝟯.

Modern LLMs are heavily trained on being helpful, harmless and be aligned to user intent. But in practice, that can morph into something dangerous in enterprise settings: 𝘀𝘆𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝘆𝗲𝘀-𝗺𝗲𝗻.\n\nHave you experienced this?\n • You suggest a solution, and the model “refines” it instead of challenging it.\n • You embed a wrong assumption in your prompt, and it builds a beautiful, confident answer on top of it.\n • You ask for a comparison, and it over-weights your preferred option because your prompt sounded more enthusiastic about it.\n\nIn other words, Your LLM isn’t always optimizing for truth. It’s optimizing for agreement + politeness.\n\nIf you’re building serious AI products, especially agents, you need 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.\n\n1.

Here's why.\n\nAI is only as useful as the access it has. Closed platforms like Shopify limit AI to official APIs, which creates a ceiling on how well they can integrate with AI.\n\nWith open source, there's no ceiling. AI can read the full codebase, trace why a query is slow, see how plugins interact. Actually diagnose problems, instead of guessing from symptoms.\n\nWooCommerce is the largest open source e-commerce platform. Millions of stores hitting the same wall as they grow: slow sites, expensive fixes.\n\nThat's the gap we decided to target. One platform, one niche problem.\n\nThe bigger vision? Software that heals and customizes itself. No waitings. No tickets. AI that watches, diagnoses, and fixes continuously.\n\nWe're starting with self-optimizing. Slow queries, code paths, get found and fixed. \n\nPerformance improves automatically. The store gets better while you sleep.\n\nCRO customisations comes next, but first we prove it works here.",

Every cell in your body is in competition. All neighbors are in competition. All nations and all species.\n\nIran has been announcing the US and Israel as enemies for decades and constantly threatening them with death. What do you expect? The US and Israel protecting Iran when there is an uprising opportunity from people against the Islamic Republic regime? Of course they help the protests escalate as much as possible, and I am sure they did help. Also, they are not that stupid to mass-kill their own protesters to the extent of stopping the protests.\n\nWe Iranians who lived in Iran during the IR era and went to school in their educational system are very familiar with which system can comfortably kill people and invite others to kill. There is no city in Iran that has not had public executions where school kids could come and watch the scene. Meanwhile, in the so-called evil countries, companies get prosecuted for showing movies with inappropriate scenes at times when kids might be able to watch them.\n\nSo yes, we are not naïve enough to think the US and Israel have no benefit here, but you are stupid to think the IR is a sane governing entity that has the right to rule the Iranian people while killing them comfortably to protect itself. #Iran",

It would be incredibly easy to conduct even a basic, random survey—ask 100 Iranians whether they want regime change or whether they support Western military intervention. Speaking for Iranians without listening to them is not analysis; it’s an assumption.\n\n2️⃣ Imagine a deadly virus spreading through a country, killing unarmed civilians, while other nations have the vaccine. Would the people suffering say, “This is purely our internal matter, please don’t help us”? Of course not.\n\nThe Islamic Republic is acting like a lethal virus against its own people—people who are unarmed and denied basic rights. This is not a political abstraction; it is a humanitarian reality.\n\nYou don’t need to be a genius to understand this. Just be rational and listen to Iranians themselves—and stop dismissing their voices.",

The West allegedly planned to hijack the protests and turn them into a revolution. The government claims it acted to protect citizens.\n\nA sane and responsible government in such a situation would:\n- Clearly identify official security forces so people know who is there to protect them.\n- Keep fast, accessible communication channels open so citizens can report suspicious activity.\n- Ensure hospitals and healthcare systems are fully prepared and reinforced to treat the injured.\n\nWhat actually happened instead:\n- Awareness was reduced — armed individuals appeared without clear identification.\n- All communication systems were shut down.\n- Hospital systems were disrupted, and security forces were placed in hospitals to prevent them from accepting patients.\n\nNow, let’s analyze this from the perspective of a terrorist planning to infiltrate a protest (Terrorism 101):\n- Never use traceable communication like public internet.\n- Operate where awareness is lowest — avoid official military or clearly guarded locations.\n- De-prioritize heavily protected places (such as hospitals) unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThe conclusion is unavoidable.\nThe Islamic Republic has demonstrated such extreme incompetence that its collapse seems inevitable — not only because of cruelty, but because of sheer inability to govern.\n\nTo the leadership:\nIf you believe you are wise but your ideology has not changed, then you should leave — as the Shah did.\nBut if you claim wisdom and genuine patriotism, then step aside, hand power back to the people, and appear before a court of justice — as Hoveida did.\n\nHistory always delivers its verdict.",

Assume that we and our older-generation parents in Iran, under the previous Shah regime, were a couple who, right or wrong, decided to divorce. We decided to marry the U.S. (which is equipped with the strongest army in the world) and move to live with them, while our partner (other Iranians) were decided—or forced—to marry the Islamic Republic along with our children (the younger generation in Iran).\n\nFor years, you hear that your children (the young generation in Iran) are suffering from hardship and limitations forced on them by the new stepfather (the Islamic Republic). Then one night, you are walking by their house and hear screaming for help (the stepfather is beheading us). You see blood flowing behind the door, and you look at your partner, with the best gun locked and loaded, and ask them to intervene.\n\nAll of a sudden, the neighbors, who are also hearing the screams for help, look at your partner and tell them, “Please do not shoot; the noise will disturb us. Let’s be patient and talk to them,” or “This is their own problem; let them solve it themselves.” \n\nThe U.S., we are your living partner(there are 10s of millions of us); they are our children, and we still love them.

        "content": "After the fall of the Shah, the Islamic Republic declared itself an enemy of U.S. power and the global capitalist order. This was not an accident, nor was it forced. It was a deliberate choice. By making that choice, the regime knowingly entered a long-term confrontation and a sustained political and economic conflict with the West.\nThe response from the United States and its allies was entirely predictable. Economic sanctions are the standard tool used against any state that challenges their interests. Iran was not singled out. Even close allies, including Canada, have faced sanctions under different circumstances. The outcome was never a mystery.\nYet Iran’s leadership repeatedly told its people that sanctions were meaningless “just pieces of paper.” They promised resilience, control, and victory. This was not optimism; it was deception.\nAs sanctions took effect, the economy deteriorated. Inflation exploded. Jobs disappeared. Basic dignity became unaffordable. At this point, the government changed its tune. Suddenly, every economic failure was blamed on the U.S. and the West, while decades of corruption, incompetence, and catastrophic mismanagement were erased from the story.\nEventually, the pressure became unbearable. People rose up, knowing the risk and accepting the possibility of death. And death came—on a scale so vast it stunned even those familiar with state violence. So unbelievable that history has not seen many of its kind. \nNow, once again, the regime points outward. It claims the U.S. and the West are responsible for the bloodshed.\nThis accusation collapses under the weight of one simple question:\nIf you could not protect your people from poverty,\nand you could not protect them from bullets,\nThen what exactly was your role?\n\nYou failed economically. You failed morally. You failed in the most basic duty of governance: protecting human life.\n\nSo on what grounds, what authority, and what legitimacy do you still claim the right to rule a people you could neither sustain nor defend?",

From writing the first line of code at 9 to earning the first paycheck at 11, from leaving home at 14 to selling my first company at 16, I have had my share of professional experience. After dropping out of the high school, I was declared the youngest Indian CEO by various digital and print publications at age 18.\n\nAfter 2 successful exits at 16 and 19, I built The Indian Wire, an online publication to empower the next generation of Indian internet users accessing the internet in their native language. Along with that, I head an NGO, Empowering Rajasthan, which helps rural women and students across the state of Rajasthan to take entrepreneurial route to improve their life standard. I have worked in various capacities with multiple state governments in India to help implement government schemes targeted to the youth in general and students in specific.\n\nAfter being a high school dropout for years, I got back to formal education to earn a law degree to better understand the complexities of the legal and financial world. Carrying forward the new found love for law and finance, I pursued a masters degree in International Financial Law at the prestigious King's College London.\n\nCurrently, I head Backstage with Millionaires (Towards Ventures). An online community of entrepreneurs and like minded individuals to celebrate entrepreneurship with various types and levels of collaboration to shape the Indian Startup Ecosystem and to inspire the gen-next to take the risky route.\n\nAt Towards Ventures, while we showcase the Indian Startup Ecosystem to the world, we are also looking for better and innovative ways to help non-institutional and individual investors invest in Indian startups and to be a part of Indian growth story as the country gets ready to become a super power in world economy.\n\nThe next big goal of my life is to try to give back to society in form of my efforts to help the younger generation take over the world. I am actively involved with the student community and have spoken at over 300 schools and colleges across the country, while being on the official mentor board of tens of them.\n\nIf you have an idea and want to talk about conquering the world, feel free to hit me up!

And the data shows major structural issues:\n\n1) Payments are ubiquitous but not budgeting-friendly\n\nIndia’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) now handles ~20+ billion transactions per month and makes up ~85% of digital payment volumes. That dominance not only reflects day-to-day usage like paying for groceries, food, transport & services but also frictionless spending. Quick scans make budgeting feel invisible.  \n\n2) Recurring payments are growing fast but often fail\n\nUPI AutoPay has become the dominant recurring payment mechanism in India, accounting for ~60%+ of recurring transactions in late 2025, even though success rates are low by global standards. This means young people signing up for subscriptions and bills can face failed debits due to fluctuating balances.  \n\n3) Everyday consumption is going digital but tracking lags\n\nMedia reports suggest that UPI payments roughly correlate with ~58% of typical household consumption spending in a given month, especially in high-frequency categories like groceries, telecom and fast food.  \n\n4) Cards and credit aren’t yet mainstream\n\nIndia has 50 crore+ UPI users, but fewer than 5 crore credit card holders, meaning most young Indians don’t have traditional credit tools to help with budgeting or rewards. Auto-debit tools like cards still lag behind UPI in recurring utility.  \n\nNow consider the psychology of finance:\n\nWhen payments are frictionless but visibility is not, people overspend without realising it.\n\nMultiple studies link digital payments with “invisible spending” and harder budgeting.  \n\nWhen recurring payments fail due to low balances, utilities aren’t paid on time, a behavioural penalty that feels personal, not structural.  \n\nWhen most payments are done via apps that don’t natively help categorise or forecast, young Indians juggle multiple apps and bank SMS just to see where their money went.\n\nPersonal finance isn’t just about tools, it’s about understanding behaviour.\n\nYoung Indians are excellent adopters of digital payments, but not necessarily managers of them yet.\n\nThe opportunity isn’t just financial inclusion.\n\nIt’s financial literacy and visibility. Build tools that help people see, not just tap, where their money goes.\n\nExcited to be building a solution that solves exactly this for Young India!! Stay tuned!",

And that’s the difference between policy noise and ecosystem building.\n\nIf compute and data become as foundational as bandwidth did for the internet, India’s startup wave will look very different, and much bigger.\n\nExcited to see how this shapes up over the next 5 years or so..",

    "bio": "Helping Developers build and work with RemoteAgent | AI Field Engineer @ Closerlook.AI Hi, I’m Harsha!\nMy tech journey began out of necessity and quickly evolved into a lifelong passion. At 18, I taught myself to code to build my first app—an experience that sparked my love for technology and set the foundation for everything that followed.\n\nDriven by that passion, I went on to found my own company, where I help startups and small businesses develop MVPs (Minimum Viable Products). In just one year, I’ve partnered with over 20 clients, bringing their product ideas to life with scalable, production-ready solutions.\n\nAfter earning my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2022, I joined Genpact, working as a Full-Stack Java Developer for General Electric (GE). I built and optimized six critical application features as part of a fast-paced Agile team.\n\nI recently completed my Master’s in Information Technology at the University of New Hampshire, graduating with a 3.97 GPA. During this time, I interned as a Founding Engineer at RiteDot Teknologies, where I built and deployed two full-stack platforms, set up scalable cloud infrastructure with Docker and AWS, and implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.\n\nI’m passionate about backend engineering, AI, and infrastructure. I’ve built projects like GitFox, an AI-powered PR review bot using Rust + OpenAI, and InsightsX, a Rust-based observability tool that processes millions of logs with sub-second latency. I even created my own programming language and an AI agent that can autonomously write and deploy a web server.\n\nOutside of work, I’m the founder and president of Tech Tribe, the leading tech club at UNH, where I strive to build a vibrant community of makers and developers.\n\nFeel free to connect with me at 📞 +1 (603) 268-5600 or 📧 harshapalnati@gmail.com — always open to collaboration, new ideas, and innovative teams.",

        "content": "I Built a Local AI Chatbot on My Phone with React Native (and it was surprisingly easy)\n\nI recently stumbled upon the RunAnywhere SDKs and decided to try something that sounded difficult on paper: running a Language Model (LLM) locally on my mobile device using React Native.\n\nNo API keys, no cloud costs, just raw AI running on the phone's hardware.\n\nThe result? It was actually incredibly fun, and I got it working in under 100 lines of logic. Here is my experience building a \"SmolLM2\" chat app.\n\nWhy Run Locally?\nUsually, when we build AI apps, we just fetch data from an OpenAI or Anthropic API. But running it locally on the device (\"Edge AI\") feels like \n\nPrivacy: The data never leaves the phone.\n\nOffline: It works in an airplane or a subway.\n\nCost: Free. No token usage fees.\n\nThe Tech Stack\nReact Native: For the UI.\n@runanywhere/core: The main SDK to manage models.\n@runanywhere/llamacpp: The backend to run GGUF models.\nSmolLM2-360M: A tiny but mighty model optimized for speed.\n\nThe Experience\nI tested this using the SmolLM2 360M model. Because the model is small (quantized to Q8), it downloaded quickly and the inference speed on my mobile device was snappy.\n\nIt’s a different feeling knowing that the intelligence you are interacting with is sitting right there in your hand, not in a server farm in Virginia.\n\nIt’s fun, it’s easy, and it’s the future of mobile apps.\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #MobileDevelopment #ReactNative #EdgeComputing #OnDeviceAI #SoftwareEngineering #OpenSource #TechInnovation #Privacy #LLMs",

        "content": "The Cost of Abstraction: Why PyTorch isn't always the answer.\n\nI recently fine-tuned the GPT-OSS 20B model on a single Tesla T4 (16GB) GPU. To make it fit, I used Unsloth.\n\nThe experience highlighted an interesting engineering distinction between Unsloth and standard PyTorch.\n\nThe \"Standard\" Way (PyTorch): PyTorch is built for flexibility. When you run a training loop, it typically executes generic kernels for every operation (Normalizations, Attentions, RoPE embeddings). It creates a computational graph that is easy to debug but often computationally wasteful. It reads and writes to memory frequently, creating fragmentation and overhead.\n\nOn a memory-constrained card like a T4, this overhead is fatal. You either run out of VRAM (OOM) or hit stability issues (NaN errors) because the generic kernels aren't optimized for the specific mixed-precision quirks of older hardware.\n\nThe \"Optimized\" Way (Unsloth): Unsloth isn't just a wrapper; it drops down a level. Instead of relying on PyTorch's autograd to figure out the backward pass, they have manually derived the backpropagation math and rewritten the GPU kernels in OpenAI Triton.\n\nBy hand-writing these kernels, they \"fuse\" multiple operations into one. This means:\n- Fewer Memory Reads/Writes: The GPU doesn't have to keep fetching data for every tiny step.\n- Less VRAM Overhead: Intermediate states that PyTorch would store are never created.\n- Manual Stability: They handle the precision math explicitly, preventing the crashes common on T4s.\n\nThe Takeaway: PyTorch is amazing because it lets you build anything. Unsloth is interesting because it shows what happens when you optimize specifically for one thing (LLM training).\n\nIf you are interested in trying it out, check the Unsloth notebook in the comments. \n\n#MachineLearning #PyTorch #Unsloth #Engineering #DeepLearning #LLM",

But sitting down to write the Self-Attention mechanism and Residual Connections line-by-line taught me more about AI than any API ever could.\n\nThe journey:\nStarting with random gibberish (Loss: 4.6).\nImplementing the Causal Mask so the model couldn't \"cheat\" by looking at the future.\nTraining on Shakespeare and watching the model actually start to form words (Loss: 2.5).\n\nIt isn't about the size of the model; it's about the depth of the understanding. Every \"billion-parameter\" giant is just thousands of these small \"Lego bricks\" stacked together.\nFundamentals first.

        "content": "Models like GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 excel at describing images, but they struggle with tasks requiring pixel-level precision or structured, verifiable output. They're monolithic inference engines, great for interpretation, limited for production pipelines.\n\nI just read VLM Run's whitepaper on Orion, and it tackles this exact problem with a fundamentally different architecture.\n\nThe Core Problem\n\nTraditional VLMs try to handle everything like object detection, OCR, segmentation, and spatial reasoning in a single neural pass. This works for general understanding, but fails when you need:\n\nExact bounding box coordinates (not approximate descriptions)\nPixel-perfect segmentation masks\nVerifiable structured data (JSON schemas, not freeform text)\nMulti-step workflows with deterministic intermediate outputs\n\nHow Orion Solves This\n\nOrion shifts from a monolithic predictor to a unified visual agent that orchestrates specialized computer vision tools:\n\n1. Tool Delegation Over Learned Weights\nInstead of predicting \"there are approximately 5 birds,\" Orion calls a detection model and returns: [{class: \"bird\", bbox: [0.23, 0.45, 0.12, 0.18], confidence: 0.94}, ...]\n\n2. ReAct-Style Planning + Execution + Reflection\n\nPlan: Decomposes requests using chain-of-thought reasoning, determines tool sequences and data dependencies\nExecute: Invokes tools sequentially or in parallel based on constraints\nReflect: Uses a VLM-as-a-Judge to validate outputs against schemas, triggers retries on failures\n\nExample: \"Detect license plates and blur them\" requires detection → localization → inpainting in sequence, with validation at each step.\n\n3. Structured Output Enforcement\n\nEvery tool returns Pydantic-validated JSON with type-safe schemas. Segmentation masks are uint8 arrays with per-instance labels. Detections include normalized xywh bboxes. OCR returns word-level confidence scores.\nThis isn't optional formatting; it's enforced through the reflection loop.\n\nArchitecture Insight\n\nThe reflection mechanism is key: when a tool returns malformed data or the output doesn't match the expected schema, the VLM-as-a-Judge identifies the inconsistency and triggers corrective actions before proceeding. This closed-loop control is what enables multi-step workflows to succeed reliably.\n\n#ComputerVision #VisionLanguageModels #VLM #MultimodalAI #AgenticAI #ToolAugmentedAI",
